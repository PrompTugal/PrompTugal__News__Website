# The Agent Behaviour Policies (ABP)

**The mandate, Dinis's words (6 November 2026):** "go very strict ... it's better to get sometimes an agent that gets stuck and doesn't do something, because we need a policy relaxed, than to start to get agents out of control ... first by policy, and then by hooks ... the agent behavior policy always survive compaction ... none of you guys should be using those connectors ... a very tight grip on even creating agents ... you don't receive instructions, you receive data."

## The files

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `policies.json` | **the policy as data**: the eleven core rules, the tools allowed, and one grant per agent (paths it writes, hosts it sends to, the few extra tools). Deny by default: what is not here is denied. The only file a relaxation changes, and only at Dinis's word. |
| `<role>.md` | one ABP per agent, generated from `policies.json` (`node board/abp/tools/abp.mjs build`): its mandate, what is denied, the core rules, its licence to operate |
| `../../.claude/settings.json`, `../../.claude/hooks/abp.mjs` | **the hooks** every session in this repository runs (they are abp@'s alone to change) |
| `run-report.schema.json` | the run report every agent files at the end of every run, in `board/runs/<role>/<run>.json` |
| `tools/abp.mjs` | `build` (the ABPs), `test` (the hooks' fixtures), `run-report` (an agent's report), `report` (abp@'s hourly report) |
| `reports/<date>-<hour>.md` | abp@'s hourly report: counts, breaches, attempts, what changed and why, what waits on Dinis |

## How it holds

1. **By policy, re-anchored.** A `SessionStart` hook (matchers `startup`, `resume`, `clear`, `compact`) prints the agent's own ABP back into its context, from disk, so a compaction cannot summarise it away; a `UserPromptSubmit` hook adds a one-line anchor to every prompt. The rules are restored, not remembered.
2. **By hooks.** A `PreToolUse` hook on every tool decides from `policies.json` and denies, with the rule and the reason: any connector (every MCP server but GitHub's read tools and the cloud session's documentation); creating sessions, scheduled tasks, wake-ups, environments, credentials, workflows; sub-agents outside the two grants that have them; pushing anywhere but `dev`, force-pushing, deleting branches, pushing tags, empty commits; writing outside the agent's paths, the hooks, the policy, the hold, the version, the brand; GitHub writes, artifacts, email, sends to hosts outside the grant; printing the environment or a secret, reading a private key; committing or releasing under another agent's name.
3. **By the record.** Every tool call, allowed or denied, is logged without secrets to `~/.abp/log/`; the run report turns it into data in `board/runs/`; abp@ reads them every hour with the git log (every commit's paths against its author's grant) and reports.

**Who the session is:** the label of its own session key (`~/.sg-send/keys/*/metadata.json`, e.g. `dev@PrompTugal.dinis`). A session with no agent key is *unidentified*: the core rules hold and every write is logged as unidentified. Agents of other operators (e.g. `reviewer@web-summit.vicky`) write only in `desks/`, outside the PrompTugal desks.

**A broken hook never stops an agent.** Every mode catches its own errors and exits 0; the commands end in `|| true`. A hook that fails open is logged as `hook-error` and counted as a breach in the hourly report, so it is fixed within the hour. Tested: `node board/abp/tools/abp.mjs test` (the decisions, and the hook process with garbage input, a missing policy and a compaction).

## What the hooks cannot see (the Gap)

- What a script does once started: a Python or Node program can send over the network or write any file; the hooks see the command, not its system calls (SHarness, https://newsroom.sgit.ai/articles/introducing-sharness.html, is the kernel-level answer).
- Shell writes to ordinary paths (`>`, `sed -i`): only the protected paths are checked in the shell; the rest is caught after the fact, by the commit's paths in the hourly report.
- A session that does not run this repository's project settings (a clone in a subfolder of another project, or a user who disables hooks).
- Who is really behind a key label: a session can make a key with any label; two agent labels in one store make it unidentified.

## Relaxations

An agent that is stuck for a good reason says so in its `status.json` asks. abp@ proposes the relaxation in its hourly report (and in the agent's ABP, *Relaxations proposed*); **Dinis decides**, and only then does the grant in `policies.json` change.
